# Monty Hall Puzzle
The Monty Hall Puzzle is a famous conundrum in probability which takes the form of a hypothetical game show. The contestant is presented with three doors; behind one is a car and behind each of the other two is a goat. The contestant picks a door and then the gameshow host opens a different door to reveal a goat. The host knows which door conceals the car. The contestant is then invited to switch to the other closed door or stick with their initial choice.
